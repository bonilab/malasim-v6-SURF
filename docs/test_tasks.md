## ✅ STRENGTHS

1. **Well-Organized Structure:** Clear separation by domain, mirrors src/ structure
2. **Strong Test Fixtures:** Excellent use of base classes (PersonTestBase, RandomTestBase, EventManagerTestCommon)
3. **Statistical Rigor:** Custom helpers for chi-squared tests, mean/variance calculations for stochastic validation
4. **Mock Infrastructure:** GMock integration + centralized MockFactories.h
5. **Coverage Support:** LLVM instrumentation flags configured for coverage analysis
6. **Naming Consistency:** All tests follow `*Test.cpp` convention, test fixtures use `TEST_F`
7. **Strict Linting:** .clang-tidy enforces modern C++ standards with warnings-as-errors
8. **Global Environment:** Proper spdlog initialization prevents race conditions
9. **✨ NEW: Self-Contained Tests:** No external file dependencies, programmatic file generation
10. **✨ NEW: Template System:** Single source of truth (test_input_template.yml) for all tests

## ⚠️ GAPS & ISSUES

### 1. ✅ COMPLETED: Tests Depend on External Configuration Files
- **Status:** 🎉 **MIGRATION COMPLETE - 100% SUCCESS**
- **Achievement:** All 555 tests passing in ~12 seconds
- **Solution Implemented:** 
  - Created `tests/fixtures/MockFactories.h` - Centralized mocks for unit tests
  - Created `tests/fixtures/TestFileGenerators.h` - Programmatic file generation using yaml-cpp
  - Created `tests/fixtures/InMemoryYamlConfig.h` - In-memory YAML for config tests
  - Created `tests/fixtures/test_input_template.yml` - Complete 960-line configuration template
  - Tests now generate their own files from template, zero dependency on `sample_inputs/`
- **Tests Migrated:** 28 test files (~189 tests)
  - Configuration: yaml_population_events (3 tests)
  - Parasites: GenotypeTest (3 tests)
  - Population: 4 files (19 tests)
  - MDC: ModelDataCollectorTest (10 tests)
  - Treatment/Therapies: 7 files (50 tests)
  - Treatment/Strategies: 11 files (85 tests)
  - Treatment: LinearTCMTest (6 tests)
  - Spatial/Movement: 4 files (12 tests)
- **Key Fixes:**
  - District raster now generates 3 districts (IDs 1, 2, 3)
  - Added 2-location raster helper for location-specific tests
  - Cleanup runs at START of setup to prevent stale file corruption
  - Fixed hanging tests (MFTMultiLocationStrategy, NestedMFTMultiLocationStrategy)
  - Fixed failing test (WesolowskiSurfaceSMTest)
- **Documentation:** Complete test writing guide in `tests/README.md`
- **Ready:** ✅ Branch `test/remove-external-dependencies` ready to merge

### 2. CRITICAL: Mosquito Module Under-Tested
- **Issue:** Only 1 test file for mosquito module (2 source files in src/Mosquito)
- **Impact:** Mosquito dynamics are core to malaria simulation; insufficient coverage is high risk
- **Evidence:** `tests/Mosquito/MosquitoTest.cpp` is minimal

### 3. Integration Testing Gap
- **Issue:** All tests appear to be unit tests; no end-to-end simulation tests
- **Impact:** Can't verify that components work correctly together
- **Missing:** Full simulation runs, multi-day scenarios, cross-module interactions

### 4. Limited Mock Usage
- **Issue:** Most tests use real objects instead of mocks/stubs
- **Impact:** Tests are slow, fragile, and have complex dependencies
- **Example:** PersonTestBase creates full Model instance with real Config

### 5. Model Data Collector Under-Tested
- **Issue:** Only 1 test file for MDC (reporting/data collection)
- **Impact:** Output validation is weak; can't guarantee correct simulation results
- **Risk:** Silent data corruption in reports

### 6. Incomplete Test Coverage
- **Found:** 1 TODO comment in PersonParasiteTest.cpp
- **Issue:** Commented-out test in PersonClinicalTest.cpp (ScheduleClinicalEvent)
- **Need:** Identify and track incomplete tests

### 7. No Performance/Benchmark Tests
- **Issue:** No tests for performance regressions or scalability
- **Impact:** Can't detect performance degradation
- **Missing:** Large population tests, long simulation duration tests

### 8. Missing Test Documentation
- **Issue:** No README in tests/ explaining how to run, interpret coverage, or contribute
- **Impact:** New contributors struggle with test setup

### 9. Hardcoded Configuration
- **Issue:** MockConfig has hardcoded values scattered across test fixtures
- **Impact:** Hard to maintain, tests are brittle
- **Example:** PersonTestBase hardcodes age_structure, mortality rates

### 10. Flakiness Risk
- **Issue:** Statistical tests with stochastic components may be flaky
- **Concern:** Random seed management not clearly visible
- **Mitigation:** Needs review of RandomTest implementations for reproducibility
